The following is the breakdown of how the privacy statement will be generated.

Information

We collect the following types of information: name, contact information and how people interact with us (for the analytics).

Note that we excluded photos because we assumed that these are not personally identifiable; otherwise, I would have included these under Other.

Collection

We get this personal information by asking people directly and by using website cookies. Note that a warning will appear to check that you understand the implications of collecting other information. In this case, analytics are well understood and common case.

Purpose

We only collect personal information to keep in contact with members and inform them about developments and recent news related to the Historical Society, and also analytical information about how the website is used to allow us to improve the user experience.

Sharing

We don’t share any information with third parties about individuals.

Contact

Please contact us at admin@matahi-historical-society.org.nz (you may have added other contact details as well).

Optional info

People have a choice in whether to provide some types of personal information (a key principle). You need to tell the user what not providing certain information means. In this case, if name and contact information is not provided, they can’t receive updates from the Historical Society or maintain the membership register, and if cookies are disabled on their browser, we won’t be able to use analytics to improve the overall visitor experience.
